He learns of the timeline split due to the mobsters and the new destiny of Primis. Richtofen asks Victis if they want to go with him or if they want their journey to end, he leaves them to ponder the question. Later, he arrives back with Victis, who say they will go with Richtofen. He puts them on ice for later. Primis arrive from the Proditone Fracture after just saving Takeo's soul. Richtofen gives them six vials, Each Primis member now holds two blood vials. Post Origins Richtofen tells the other to reread the Kronorium, he does, and after learning of his new, changed fate runs after Post Origins Richtofen, who quickly enters a portal. Primis trys to escape the prison but the warden, acting on the wishes of the Shadowman destroys their last portal out, trapping them. Primis find the Warden's house and find his dead body in an electric chair. They activate the lighthouse near the Warden's house and it serves as a conduit to Samuel L. Shulinger, allowing him to think and transmit thoughts even in cyrostasis. Using the Summoning Key and the Kronorium they make a conduit to his soul. The Warden then appears behind them and locks the four of them in individual cells. Al, now in the form of a spectral bird frees them, and him and the other three mobsters help disarm the Warden.
